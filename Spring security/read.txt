What is Authentication?
Authentication ensures that the user or the client is the one who is claim to be.
There are many ways in which Spring Security enables us to perform authentication. 
Spring Security supports Basic Authentication, LDAP authentication, JDBC authentication, etc.

Authentication is the method of verifying the identity of a consumer or system to ensure theyâ€™re who they claim to be. 
It involves checking credentials which include usernames, passwords, or biometric information like fingerprints or facial recognition. 
This step is vital for securing access to systems, programs, and sensitive records. 
By confirming identities, authentication saves you from unauthorized entry and protects you against safety breaches.

What is Authorization?
Authorization ensures whether the user has permission for the action or not. 
If our application is a complex one, with different kinds of users such as admins, regular users, other less privileged users, we need to maintain access control in our application.
For example, a guest user should not be able to access admin content. 
So, to control access to various resources within our application, we need to check if a user has permission to access that resource. 
Spring Security supports roles, claims etc. to provide user level authorization.
