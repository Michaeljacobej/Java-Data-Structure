Method Overloading
Method overloading is a feature in Java that allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists to exist within the same class. It enhances the flexibility and readability of the code.

Example



Method Overriding
Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. It is a key aspect of polymorphism in Java, allowing subclasses to customize or extend the behavior of inherited methods.

Java Lambda Expressions
Lambda Expressions were added in Java 8.

A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value.
Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.
